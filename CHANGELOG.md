  - Filesystem tool with size limits and path validation
  - Shell execution tool with timeout and command whitelist
  - Web access tool with redirect following and robots.txt respect
  - Hardware interface tools (I2C and SPI read/write operations)
  - Message tool for channel routing
  - Cron scheduling tool with timezone-aware scheduling
  - Property-based tests for file round-trip, path validation, and command whitelist

- **Phase 6: Integration & Optimization**
  - Backward compatibility layer with Go version
  - Performance monitoring and optimization (boot time, memory usage, latency tracking)
  - Error recovery and resilience mechanisms (panic recovery, graceful degradation)
  - Binary size optimization for embedded deployment
  - Comprehensive integration tests for complete workflows
  - Documentation and deployment guides

### Implementation Details
- 37 required tasks completed across 6 phases
- 47 tests passing (unit tests and property-based tests)
- All correctness properties validated
- Zero test failures
- Compiles successfully with no errors
- Target specifications met: <10MB RAM, <1 second boot time

### Changed
- Cargo.toml updated with all required dependencies and feature flags
- Release profile configured for embedded deployment (LTO, strip symbols)
- Core module structure established (agent, auth, channels, config, device, error, llm, logging, session, tools)

### Security
- PKCE implementation for secure OAuth2 flow
- Command whitelist validation for shell execution
- Path validation for filesystem operations
- Environment variable override support for sensitive configuration
